# POLICIES

## Accessible, Inclusive, and Compliant Statement
The university is committed to creating an accessible
and inclusive learning environment consistent with
university policy and federal and state law. Please let
me know if you experience any barriers to learning so I
can work with you to ensure you have equal opportunity
to participate fully in this course. If you are a
student with a disability, or think you may have a
disability, and need accommodations please contact
Disability and Access (D&A). Please refer to D&A’s
website for contact and more information:
[http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/](http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/).
If you are already registered with D&A , please deliver
your Accommodation Letter to me as early as possible in
the semester so we can discuss your approved
accommodations and needs in this course.

## Policy on Academic Integrity
Students who violate University rules on academic
misconduct are subject to the student conduct process
and potential disciplinary action. A student found
responsible for academic misconduct may be assigned both
a status sanction and a grade impact for the course. The
grade impact could range from a zero on the assignment
in question up to a failing grade in the course. A
status sanction can range from probation, deferred
suspension and/or dismissal from the University. To
learn more about academic integrity standards, tips for
avoiding a potential academic misconduct violation, and
the overall conduct process, please visit the Student
Conduct and Academic Integrity website at:
[http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct](http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct).

## Class Recordings
Class recordings are reserved only for students in this
class for educational purposes and are protected under
FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the
class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a
student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.

## Personal Pronouns
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender identity & expression, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name, unless they have added a “chosen name” with the registrar’s office, which you can do so here: [https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/ais/chosen_name/](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/ais/chosen_name/). I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what appears on the official roster, and by the pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so that I may make appropriate updates to my records. For instructions on how to add your pronouns to Canvas, visit [https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/633028/pages/profile-pronouns](https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/633028/pages/profile-pronouns). More resources available on the Gender and Sexuality Center’s website, [https://www.utgsc.org](https://www.utgsc.org).


## Basic Needs Security
Any student who faces challenges securing their food or housing and believes this may affect their performance in the course is urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. UT maintains the UT Outpost ([https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/utoutpost.php](https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/utoutpost.php)) which is a free on-campus food pantry and career closet. Furthermore, please notify the professor if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable him to provide any resources that he may possess.

## Mental Health Information
I urge students who are struggling for any reason and who believe that it might impact their performance in the course to reach out to me if they feel comfortable. This will allow me to provide any resources or accommodations that I can. If immediate mental health assistance is needed, call the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC) at 512-471-3515 or you may also contact Bryce Moffett, LCSW (iSchool CARE counselor) at 512-232-2983. Outside CMHC business hours (8am-5pm, Monday-Friday), contact the CMHC 24/7 Crisis Line at 512-471-2255.

## LGBTQIA+ Community
As an institution committed to creating a safe and inclusive learning environment, The University of Texas at Austin strictly prohibits discrimination, harassment, or marginalization based on sexual orientation or gender identity under Title IX. If you encounter any discrimination or harassment, please seek support from the Title IX office.

I am committed to creating a safe and inclusive learning environment for all students.  This includes fostering an environment of respect, openness, and understanding in the classroom and actively working to address any discrimination or harassment that may occur.
