# Description

This course focuses on the unique design practice of (1) representing and organizing information to facilitate perception and understanding (information architecture) and (2) specifying the appropriate mechanisms for accessing and manipulating task and play information (interaction design). This course also explores design patterns appropriate for the UX professional.

# Objectives - skills

- Identify complementary skills and congruent
    domains among potential project group partners.
- Conduct iterative design, including design, prototyping, and evaluation.
- Conduct a contextual inquiry.
- Construct personas suggested by a contextual
  inquiry.
- Construct a low fidelity prototype using pencil and
  paper.
- Construct a high fidelity prototype using tools of your
  own choosing.
- Evaluate a high fidelity prototype using heuristic
  evaluation or methods of your own choosing.
- Sketch designs quickly and with facility.
- Solve generic design problems quickly in an ad hoc
  group, mastering both the divergent and convergent
  activities required.
- Tell the story of a design problem and solution
  through a series of sketches.
- Contribute to a project group over the course of a
  semester and overcome project group problems.
- Create a project group website that communicates the
  substance of your semester-long project.
- Work with a client whose constraints are not under your
  control.

# Objectives - concepts

- Understand the role of constraints in design.
- Understand affordances.
- Understand the history of and basic definitions
    common in interaction design.
- Understand theories in human computer interaction
    such as Fitts's Law and Hick's Law and the
    characteristics of theories.
- Understand interaction paradigms.
- Understand four common interaction styles and the
    characteristics favoring their use.
- Understand two different ways to elicit and interpret verbal
    information from users of a system, protocol analysis
    and verbal analysis.
- Understand the role of collaboration among users in interaction
    design.
- Understand several ways to measure quality of service.
- Understand the role of emotion in interaction design.
- Understand relevant characteristics of a range of interaction
    devices.
- Understand software documentation and the
    phenomena taking its place.

# Materials

## Textbook
We will rely on portions of four books: @Cooper2014, @Dodson2006, @Holtzblatt2005, and @Rosenfeld2015. I am apparently allowed to put three chapters of any book on Canvas, and I have done so with these books. In addition, some of them are available for free at the library.

The study guide (on Canvas) is the only other required textbook for the course.

## Notebook
You should bring a paper notebook to class every day and be prepared to upload pictures from it frequently. The notebook should be the size of the Moleskine Cahier notebook, 5 $\times$ 8.25 inches. It is widely available in packs of three for about 15\textsc{usd}. Substitute any sketchbook of similar size, e.g., Malvern Books has Leuchturm sketchbooks, which have higher quality paper than Moleskine but are more expensive. Why do I insist on this size? You actually draw differently on larger notebooks due to the average shape and size of the human hand.

You should only write or draw in the notebook and not staple or paste scans or photos into it. All the work in the notebook should be in pen or pencil, preferably pencil.

## Phone or tablet with camera
You should bring a phone or tablet or some device with a camera to class and be prepared to photograph your work to share it with the class.

## Technology
Except for Framer, specific software packages will not be taught in this course. Students should use judgment to select and use helpful software and should share their experiences with different software packages during discussion. Different students have different software needs. It makes sense to try a lot of different software packages to keep you open-minded but to polish your skills with a few to help you meet tight deadlines.

# Grading
I plan to grade assignments within two weeks of their due date except where circumstances interfere.
The grading scale used along with the grade components follow.

- A  >= 94.0%
- A- >= 90.0% & < 94%
- B+ >= 87.0% & < 90%
- B  >= 83.0% & < 87%

- F  < 60.0%

## Attendance
I will take attendance every day and your percentage of attendance will count for ten percent of your grade.

If you have a legitimate need for absence, such as illness or job interview, notify the instructor by email as soon as possible and you may receive an excused absence.
