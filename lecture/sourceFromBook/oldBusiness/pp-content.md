A student wrote to me expressing that she had a hard time "wading through the supplemental notes." In the same message, she suggested that I use Powerpoint, assuring me that it can work well for certain purposes.

I want to help you. I want you to extend yourself. Being a student means exposing yourself to new and different ways of doing things. I want you to abandon your reliance on Powerpoint this semester and try to use different ways to understand material.

To support you, there are a few readings that may help. First, there's a file called Tufte2006.pdf under Content > Resources on MyCourses. This chapter presents a repudiation of Powerpoint based on its information content and suitability to intended purpose.

Tufte invokes Feynman as someone who was appalled by bullet points. Feynman's Lectures on Physics are perhaps the most important vehicle for college students learning physics and they may present an alternative to which educators can aspire.

The second is actually a video. Visit Youtube and search for pixar storyboarding.

Third is a profile of a team of high-school students who won a robotics competition in 2005. During the question and answer round of the competition, they raised the judge's eyebrows because they did not provide a Powerpoint. When asked why, they answered that Powerpoint was for people who did not know what to say. The judge was impressed by their responses to questions.

Please bear in mind that no important works in history have been accomplished in Powerpoint format. The only valuable Powerpoint of which I have ever heard was an experiment by David Byrne and Brian Eno to create art out of Powerpoint.

H.R. McMaster hates Powerpoint. Like Lou Gerstner at IBM, McMaster banned Powerpoint among his staff.

Beware of "good" Powerpoint.
