## computer or information?

The typical name for a section like this would be 
*computer users* but I have chosen to call it 
information users instead. This is because the range of 
devices with which people interact is wider than it was 
during the era in which people began to study computer 
users, so many of the axioms and assumptions of that era 
are no longer relevant. I could call it *device users* 
but the central concern of all these devices is the 
storage, processing, or transmission of information, so 
I've chosen to use the word *information* as a more 
general umbrella.

## academic communities studying information users

The topic has been studied by three main academic
communities, human factors in engineering schools, human
computer interaction in computer science schools, and
management information systems in business schools.
Each of the three has specialized to some extent but
there are overlaps.

## human factors

*Human factors* is usually the experimental study of how
people operate complex machines like automobiles, ships,
nuclear reactors, and aircraft. Since the researchers
who identify themselves this way are usually funded by
the military, they emphasize military applications
although their findings are usually applicable to some
degree outside the military.

## human computer interaction

*Human computer interaction* was, until recently,
primarily the study of one person
interacting with one computer system. This field began
with the study of users of expensive computers
performing specialized work tasks. During this period,
the field mainly studied how the user interface affected
some measure of productivity, usually in laboratory
studies. The second period of human
computer interaction research studied how people
interact casually with computers. This involved field
studies with very small groups of participants (formerly
called users) and very limited conclusions, appropriate
to the increased pace of change in user interfaces.

## emerging communities

It's easier to identify past epochs than current ones.
It appears that human computer interaction has diverged
into two areas in the current era but the distinction is
harder to be certain of without the advantage of years
of hindsight. The two current branches appear to be
*ubiquitous computing* and *computing communities*.

## ubicomp

*Ubiquitous computing* is old term referring to
computers embedded in other devices and able to
communicate with each other. When first coined around 1991, the term
meant anything that was not a desktop computer and
concerned a small, well-defined community. Today, almost
no interaction between computers and people can be
defined with respect to only a desktop computer,
rendering the original definition moot. Now it seems to
encompass all computing.

## community computing

*Community computing* is not a broadly used term by
itself. I am using it here to refer to the change in focus
from a single person (formerly a user) to many people
forming a community. Two types of communities exist,
communities that occur in computer networks and
communities that exist in the physical world. Since the
latter may share sewers, electrical utilities,
telecommunications utilities, roads, schools, local
governments, and other aspects of physical
infrastructure, it differs greatly from a network-only
community such as Facebook.

## remote communities

Communities that can function remotely, such as
Facebook, are the focus of study of Social Network
Analysis and Data Science, closely related fields whose
work is enabled by monitoring electronic communication
networks.

## physically colocated communities

Communities that exist in physical space, such as
neighborhoods and cities, are obviously the subject of
study of architects, social workers, and people in many
other disciplines. Recently, many of these researchers
and their sponsors have aligned with computer scientists
identified with human computer interaction.

## MIS

*Management Information Systems* the host discipline for
this course, has long been concerned with the adoption
and diffusion of technological innovation in productive
organizations. This concern has led to many
psychological studies of groups of users of information
systems in organizations.

## user experience

The required reading `08waysToStudyUsers.pdf` is a 2000 article
by Clay Spinuzzi
about three ways to study the user experience *in situ*.

## three ways to study users

Spinuzzi (2000) compares contextual inquiry with other
approaches, so you can see why we emphasize contextual
inquiry and what we might do instead (ethnography or
participatory design).

## contextual inquiry

The key sentence in the article
suggests using contextual inquiry to make radical
changes in a short time frame. It relies on an
underlying work structure that reduces the amount of
time you have to spend to understand the workplace, so
it's not suitable for completely alien work processes.

## participatory design

Participatory design works well for incremental changes
and empowering users.

## ethnography

Ethnography works best if a great deal of time (both
client time and designer time) is available and a
detailed understanding is required.  The classic example
of this in information technology is Stephen Barley's
studies of technology adoption by radiologists. Barley
obtained an MD in the course of his study.

## contextual inquiry

*Spinuzzi (2000) on contextual inquiry*

- radical changes
- reliance on underlying structure
- minimal client time

## ethnography

*Spinuzzi (2000) on ethnography*

- radical changes
- only choice in exotic workplace
- maximal client time

## participatory design

*Spinuzzi (2000) on participatory design*

- incremental changes
- empowers users
- maximal client time

## contextual design

The second required reading for this section, `08contextualDesign.pdf`,
describes the most commonly used of the above three methods.
It's the most common for a chain of reasons. First,
the reliance on an underlying work structure minimizes the
need for client time, always an attractive feature in a
resource-constrained workplace. Second, the direct manipulation of
the underlying work structure means that existing design
artifacts can be sidestepped and radical changes are 
possible without time-consuming study and modification of
existing design artifacts.

## popularity of contextual design

Because contextual inquiry and its umbrella, contextual
design, have been so successful and so inexpensive to
implement, you are more likely to participate in it in the
workplace than in any other design method.
One hallmark of contextual design you may experience is the
method's reliance on extremely large numbers of post-it
notes containing atomic observations about the subject work.

## contextual design process

A team conducting a contextual inquiry typically immerses
itself in a mass of these post-it notes, following a
structured
method for grouping and regrouping the notes to make sense
of the subject work and to organize the observations of the
client participants to reveal the essential characteristics
that will inform the new design.

## immersion

Beyer and Holtzblatt's picture of immersion follows.

## affordance

- that aspect of a thing you can interact with that
suggests how to interact with it
- can be done well or poorly
- central concept for individual user
- often skeuomorphic
- flat design opposes notion of need for affordance

## exercise: redesign an affordance
\subt{find a bad affordance}

Look in three places

- automobile interior
- public places---parking meter, atm, automatic doors,
  $\ldots$
- kitchen

Find a thing you can interact with in each place and

- tell what's wrong with it that makes it harder to know
how to interact with it
- Redesign it, keeping in mind money is not free

## exercise: find out what they know

Conduct a contextual inquiry on a workplace to which you
have access, using the techniques described
by Beyer and Holtzblatt.
