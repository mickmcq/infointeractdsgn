# Bertin exercise critiques

Thanks to the two students who worked with me on this study of one student's solution to the Bertin exercise. This study is more detailed than what I expected you to do in class but serves to illustrate the process.

##
The Invariant

The invariant should be reflected in the title of the information graphic. If it is not included, or if it can be improved, it is appropriate for the critique to include a suggestion. In this case, the invariant seems to me to be *Number of establishments by Size, County, and NAICS*. Both the content and the order of this invariant matter, as will become clear in the following paragraphs.

This invariant appropriately summarizes the information graphic.

Having critiqued the invariant and suggested a solution, I am in a position to answer the first of the three questions I ask you to consider for every exercise, whether the student has tackled a worthy problem. Certainly I believe that this is the case here because it is of interest to a great many people to summarize economic activity of a state by number of establishments, size of establishments, specific county of establishments, and kind of establishments. (The NAICS, which stands for North American Industry Classification System, is a standard for describing kinds of businesses). This is not a controversial claim because a great deal of policy and economic activity depends on such summaries.

## The components

The components are represented in the information graphic and one way to identify them is to see what is displayed. The $x$ and $y$ axes are frequently used to explore the most important components. Here, the $y$ axis displays the number of establishments, an integer ranging from 0 to 700. The $x$ axis displays bars representing combinations of counties and NAICS codes.

I have mentioned that each component should have a legend. The above components don't really have a complete legend, although Bertin would consider the axis labels to be part of a legend.

There is one legend. That legend depicts two categories of size, so size is the remaining component. We could make different claims about the characteristics of the retinal variables involved in this component and we will do so later.

For now, let us list the components along with their orders, lengths, and levels. Remember that order refers to raw numbers or percentages (usually based on population or area), length refers to the number of objects being represented, and level refers to nominal, ordinal, or quantitative measurements.

Number of establishments is an integer, evidently ranging from 1--700. Its order is raw, its length is either 700, the total number of establishments in a county/NAICS combination or the total number of establishments overall. Its level is quantitative because we can easily say that twenty establishments is twice as many as ten establishments. In other words, we can form a meaningful ratio between measures of the component.

Size has the order raw because it refers to number of employees rather than number of employees as a percentage of available working age population, for instance. Size has length 2 because we can only distinguish between establishments with fewer or more than twenty employees. Size is of ordinal level because we can say that an establishment in the 20 and over category is larger than an establishment in the under 20 category but we can't say how much larger given this information.

County is of raw order, of length either 7 (represented) or 36 (available in the entire state), and of level nominal because one county is not countier than another. Note that an attribute of county like name is ordinal in an alphabetical sense and an attribute of county like area is quantitative. All this component does, though, is to identify counties.

NAICS is a little trickier. I will call its order raw because of the way we use it here, but each code represents a location in a hierarchy of specialization so another interpretation might be arguable. Its length could be construed as the number of different codes represented in the graphic or in the state or in the entire catalog. Its level is also tricky because of the hierarchical ordering of the codes. I will call it nominal for our purposes because I have seen no evidence that it is meant to be used in another way.

To critique the components alone is simply to say whether they make sense as components of this graphic. More important is to critique their representation by retinal variables and to see if they are well matched to their retinal variables and whether better use could be made of the retinal variables *used up* by each component.

## Retinal Variables

Bertin describes the retinal variables in a dense, 438 page book. There is a lot to say. Nevertheless, we will consider the retinal variables depicted in the slideshow at a very basic level. The retinal variables include size, value, texture, color, orientation, and shape.

Three of the retinal variables here are described on the axes by bars. Bar height is very well matched to an integer ranging from 0 to 700, so I regard the use of the $y$ axis to describe number of firms as successful. There is no other component as well suited to representation by bar height in the data.

County and NAICS are described on the $x$ axis by the bar names. A tractable number of combinations has been shown. One shortcoming of this graphic is that there are not instructions to the assistant mentioned in the assignment spec. Recall that you were contributing a sketch and instructions to someone polishing the graphic. There is not enough to go on. This, among other issues, has led me to rethink the picture / word ratio constraint on sketchbooks. Instead, I would like to use picture amount and let words appear as needed without penalty.

One question about these two components, County, and NAICS, is whether they should be considered as one component or separately. That will remain an open question for now.

Finally, we come to the Size component. The representation of this component allows a number of interpretations.
We could refer to the choice of solid black and diagonal hatching as values, since one can be interpreted as black and the other as gray. We could also regard them as colors gray and black. We could also regard them as having orientation in the case of the hatching versus no orientation in the case of the black. Finally, we could consider them has having texture since we could call the black smooth and the hatching ridged.

One point Bertin makes about using more than one retinal variable to depict a component is that retinal variables may reinforce each other or be in conflict with each other. In the latter case, cognitive dissonance may be produced in the mind of the viewer. From Bertin's perspective, cognitive dissonance is always bad. Many people who produce information graphics seek to produce cognitive dissonance for reasons involving persuasion. For example, the information graphics produced by opponents of the health care plans of two recent US presidents have been designed explicitly to create cognitive dissonance in the minds of viewers. This usage stands outside Bertin's system which seeks only to support immediate answers to simple questions about information.

In this case, my reading is that the various retinal variables work together, reinforcing a consistent reading. It is not surprising that diagrams of this style may be seen in many publications. They serve an informative purpose.
