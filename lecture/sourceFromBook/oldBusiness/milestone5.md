# Milestone 5

The majority of students seem to prefer either a prototype or an IA milestone. There are good reasons for this.

## For IA

- lack of comfort with ia
- need for tools to organize information in prototype
- important to future careers
- mapping of information to interface

## For prototype

- desire to explore more tools
- realization that they could things differently now

# My choice

I can not develop a good IA milestone specification. The IA world is in some disarray with a hodgepodge of tools. Much of what can be done would be to identify IA elements (as you have done) or to do card sorts (as you have done).

It would be easier for me to describe IA characteristics and issues than to assign IA tools. I believe that if I lecture on IA, you can find individual elements to add to your prototypes, but they will not be the same or to the same extent in each group.

There are specific reasons I want new prototypes from most of the groups. This is because I want you to insert more social presence indicators and more identity and to make more explicit choices between all the things you might do. It would also benefit some of your prototypes to be less desktoppy in my view. At least, I would like you to address these issues.
