## Disability-specific design
RIT is notable for its emphasis on accessibility. The HCI group features a number of world class researchers in this area. Your advanced study in HCI can include work with some of the leading minds in the field. Although this introductory course does not emphasize accessibility, you should be introduced to some of the terms and literature in this community.

@Shinohara2016 identified four different approaches to disability-specific design and listed some of the research in each approach, which I will repeat here:

- universal design @Bigelow2012, @Mace1991
- user-sensitive inclusive design @Newell2011
- design for user empowerment @Ladner2015
- ability-based design @Wobbrock2011

Other design approaches of note include

- value-sensitive design
- design for social acceptance
