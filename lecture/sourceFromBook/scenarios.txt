### Scenarios

You can use @Cooper2014,
chapter 4 to complete the scenario portion of this milestone.

Expect your scenarios to differ from those produced by other teams.
Most teams will provide context scenarios and will use
them to address questions such as the following.
(1) What is the setting in which the product will be
used?
(2) Will it be used for extended periods of time?
(3) Will the persona be subject to frequent
interruption?
(4) Are there multiple users of a single device?
(5) What other products is it used with?
(6) How much complexity is permissible, based on
persona skill and frequency of use?
(7) What primary activities does the persona need to
accomplish to meet his / her goals?
(8) How does the product relate to the user's higher
goals?
(9) What is the expected result of using the product?

Not every team will address all these questions, nor
will every team use context scenarios.  Most teams will
create scenarios of users successfully reaching goals,
rather than scenarios showing dysfunctional outcomes.
It's often the case that the most we can say about
dysfunctional scenarios is "Okay, don't do that then."
We usually prefer richer scenarios than would be
possible in a scenario that shows failure to meet goals.
