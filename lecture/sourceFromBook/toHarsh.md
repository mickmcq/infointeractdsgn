Harsh -

I have a project I'd like you to help with as part of your TA duties.

I'm working on the study guide. I want to properly attribute all the images. I'd like you to try to find attributions for the images, or substitute images for which we can find attributions.

I've made a Google drive folder with all the images and a copy of the current version of the study guide. All the images have filenames that start with "fi". For each image, I'd like you to add a small, plain text file with the file extension ".attribution". I did one example, fiBodoniVitaN.png and fiBodoniVitaN.attribution.

I've also included a file, fiBodoniVitaNScreenshot.png, that shows how I got the attribution. On the image's Wikimedia page, there should be a link that says "use this file on the web". If you click on that, you get a dialog box that includes "Attribution". I'd like you to put the contents of that box into the .attribution file.

For some of these, it won't be possible to find a source. In that case, you can either write "source unknown" (preferably spelled the same way in each case, so my script can pick it up) or find a more suitable image that does have an attribution. For most of the images I have used, I've just grabbed them with a google image search so the images themselves should be easy to find. The attributions may not be, though. You may want to just put the URL in the .attribution file in some cases. In some cases, the attribution will just be a reference to the bibliography, such as fiSharaku.attribution. I've just entered that one myself.

If you substitute an image to get an easier attribution, just replace the image on google drive with the new image, giving it the same name. I'm not too picky about many of the images, although images from a book have to stay the same. For example, for the Thinking Fast and Slow images, the .attribution file should just say "Kahneman (2011)".

I plan to work on this study guide throughout the semester so that it's ready for the next instructor to teach the course, so time is not of the essence. If you can just work on it to fill out the hours you have available each week, which may not be any on weeks when homework is due, that would be fine.

This is a very new idea for me, so let me know of any questions or comments you have about it.

Thanks!
