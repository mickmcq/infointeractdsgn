# Interaction Design
For the next four sections: contextual inquiry, personas, scenarios, and prototyping, we are concerned with interaction design. After that, we'll think more about information design. The method of interaction design we'll practice in our prototypes in this course requires the use of these tools so that interaction designs are centered around users. There are two main textbooks for this study, both available electronically from the RIT library so that you should not need to buy either of them.

## Contextual Design
Please read @Holtzblatt2005, available electronically from the RIT library for the most complete introduction to the topic.
I can tell you
frankly that I look closely at the quality of the
affinity diagrams
for evidence of effective work on the contextual inquiry milestone.

## Three ways to study users
Spinuzzi (@Spinuzzi2000) compares contextual inquiry with other
approaches, so you can see why we emphasize contextual
inquiry and what we might do instead (ethnography or
participatory design).

## Contextual inquiry
The key sentence in @Spinuzzi2000
suggests using contextual inquiry to make radical
changes in a short time frame. It relies on an
underlying work structure that reduces the amount of
time you have to spend to understand the workplace, so
it's not suitable for completely alien work processes.
It requires minimal client time because of its reliance on underlying structure.

## Participatory design

@Spinuzzi2000 recommends participatory design for making incremental changes and empowering users. It requires a great deal of client time, used to improve user acceptance of the design.

@Bannon2018 invite us to reimagine participatory design and briefly discusses its roots in 1970s Scandinavia as a politically-oriented approach to democratizing the process of design between designers and other stakeholders. They note that the political dimension of participatory design has diminished over the years and invite a rethinking of what democracy means today. They call on researchers in an era of globalization and political extremism to use design in service of a more equitable world. They claim that that pursuit can be shaped by core emphases of participatory design, including
public participation,
sensitivity to social conflict,
shared trust,
mutual learning,
security,
and fairness.

## Ethnography

Ethnography works best if a great deal of time (both
client time and designer time) is available and a
detailed understanding of work is required.  The classic example
of this in information technology is Stephen Barley's
studies of technology adoption by radiologists. Barley
obtained an MD in the course of his incredibly long study in order to better understand the work of radiologists.

@Spinuzzi2000 claims that ethnography can be used to effect radical changes and is the only possible choice in an exotic workplace. It requires maximal client time.

@Holtzblatt2005
describes the most commonly used of the above three methods.
It's the most common for a chain of reasons. First,
the reliance on an underlying work structure minimizes the
need for client time, always an attractive feature in a
resource-constrained workplace. Second, the direct manipulation of
the underlying work structure means that existing design
artifacts can be sidestepped and radical changes are 
possible without time-consuming study and modification of
existing design artifacts.

# Contextual Inquiry Process

Because contextual inquiry and its umbrella, contextual
design, have been so successful and so inexpensive to
implement, you are more likely to participate in it in the
workplace than in any other design method.
One hallmark of contextual design you may experience is the
method's reliance on extremely large numbers of post-it
notes containing atomic observations about the subject work.

A team conducting a contextual inquiry typically immerses
itself in a mass of these post-it notes, following a
structured
method for grouping and regrouping the notes to make sense
of the subject work and to organize the observations of the
client participants to reveal the essential characteristics
that will inform the new design.

## Immersion

## Share interview techniques

You have to share your successful and unsuccessful interview techniques in a conversation. I can start the conversation with a few suggestions but you have to take from there. So here are a few commonly mentioned points about interviews.

The most successful interview has two interviewers. One takes notes and the other speaks. Don't divide the speaking. The one who takes notes should rarely speak and then only because the speaking interviewer has forgotten something. The speaking interviewer tries to maintain engagement with the subject. The speaking interviewer tries to keep the subject talking as much as possible and on-topic as much as possible. That job requires the full concentration of one person. That person should not try to do other things at the same time.

Avoid recording devices. If you do use a recorder, make it one that is very easy to operate and not intimidating and leave it on the table between you and the subject. Invite the subject to turn it off if they need to *go off the record*. You may want to turn it back on after the secrets have been shared. On the other hand, your experience may tell you that it has been inhibiting the subject or been the focus of the subject's attention. You may want to announce that we don't need it further and pocket it in that case. There is a balance, by the way, in the user interface of a recorder. It has to be able to tell you it is recording but it also has to fade into the background. Lots of recording devices, including one I often use, go too far one way or the other.

The most typical problem students have in interviews is that they fear silence. Can you allow enough silence to elapse to let your subject gather their thoughts? If not, what can you do?

Look puzzled. If there is too much eye contact, just write a question mark on your notepad or draw a simple shape like a circle or square and look puzzled again.

Look at artifacts. Any diagrams you generate in your interviews are artifacts that you can look at silently with your interview subject. Just don't say anything at all and look intently at each artifact.

Ask the same question over and over. If the subject is reluctant to speak, just ask them to *say more about that*.

Ask hypothetical questions. Activate the subject's imagination by asking them to place themselves into a situation and say what they would do.

Allow the initial speech, then stay on topic. Experience shows that subjects have rehearsed a certain speech about whatever is bothering them. They have to be allowed to declaim that speech. If not, they will keep losing track of your questions as they seek an opportunity to insert the speech. Once that is out of the way, let them refer back to it but do not allow them to repeat the whole speech or to give the certain speech about another issue. If you interview a subject about something they would like to be different, the interview may trigger associations with other things they would like to be different. You may feel the need to express empathy and tell analogous stories from your own experience. You should rehearse any such stories beforehand so you can abbreviate them as much as possible.

Overtly display respect and appreciation for the subject. I may have mentioned the robotics team of undocumented alien high-schoolers from Phoenix who defeated MIT in 2005. (There's a Wired profile of it that gets linked from various blogs every few months.) One of the key reasons they are thought to have defeated MIT was that, when they interviewed experts in underwater robotics, they treated the experts much better than did the haughty MIT team. One of the experts, interviewed by Wired later, said he gave them a lot more help than he gave the MIT team and that he began to think of himself as a member of their team. You can't buy that kind of help.

Don't bother to ask if a subject can think of anything else. Instead, stimulate them to think of something else. You can stimulate them by asking them about situations. When was the last time X happened? If they say something never happens, keep searching for that one time.

## Protocol and verbal analysis

Let us contrast two ways to find out about tasks through the words of people doing those tasks, protocol analysis
described by @Ericsson1984
vs.
verbal analysis
described by @Chi1997.

protocol analysis $\rightarrow$ *think-aloud process*

The main idea in Ericsson (1984) is to elicit
information from a person *while* they accomplish
a task by asking them to think aloud about the
information they attend to while solving problems, but
not to describe or explain.

verbal analysis $\rightarrow$ *knowledge representation*

@Chi1997 contrasts protocol analysis with an
approach designed to elicit the structure of knowledge
of the problem solver, rather than the problem solving
process.

The output of protocol analysis $\rightarrow$
 *process map*

The output of verbal analysis $\rightarrow$
 *knowledge map*

# Personas and Scenarios

For the personas milestone, let me make the very strong suggestion that you use @Cooper2014. You can obtain this electronically from the RIT library, searching for *About face the essentials of interaction design*. Chapters 3 and 4 outline the processes. You should pay special attention to Figure 3-5, Overview of the persona creation process to develop personas. (We'll talk about Chapter 4 next time.) This figure outlines eight steps to take. When I look at the milestone output, I should believe that you really followed or at least considered these steps in some detail.

How should you read @Cooper2014? I'm glad you asked. This is a very good example of why you don't need slide shows. The book is organized in a way that brings out its main points. Let's briefly review some items that identify structure and guide your assimilation of the information therein.

- Table of contents
- Orange headings
- Black headings
- Boldface terms
- Italicized emphasis
- Figures with sequences
- Figures with comparisons
- Examples
- Justifications
- Answering objections
- References
- Order of presentation

Most of the items in the list are self-explanatory. The last one, though, needs a little explanation. The order in which Chapter 3 is presented could be called a series of steps, including think, do, and reflect. First, the authors present the idea of personas, then tell you how to do them, then reflect on some of the thoughts you might have as a result of experience with personas or with alternative methods. This organizing principle might remind you of the plan-do-check-act cycle that is a foundation of quality improvement work. You could think of learning a new approach to interaction design as an example of quality improvement work. If you do, then you might think about integrating aspects of the persona approach into your larger toolbox, the lifelong toolbox you will carry with you outside of graduate school.

      }

The PDCA cycle can be traversed over and over, indefinitely. There are four main stations of the cycle.

- Plan investigations to understand the current situation
- Do implement short term fixes and long term plans to overcome root causes of problems
- Check to see the effects of implementing fixes and plans
- Act to standardize fixes and plans that succeed
