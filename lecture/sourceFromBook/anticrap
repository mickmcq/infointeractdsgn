Practitioners sometimes use the unfortunate acronym
CRAP. As far as I am concerned, CRAP is crap and I will
deduct points from any assignment that uses it. If you
say you did not see this I will deduct additional points
for failure to read required materials. If you require
an acronym for the concepts covered by that poorly
conceived acronym, I will accept GRIP:

grouping: group like elements together; separate disparate elements
restatement: clarify meaning by repetition
implied lines: align objects to minimize visual distraction
popout: make some objects appear more prominent than others
