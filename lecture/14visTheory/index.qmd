## @Wilkinson2005
chapter 2, how to make a pie

::: {.notes}
The chapter is titled How to make a pie
and it illustrates two different ways to
make a pie chart. Wilkinson begins by
noting that pie charts are ubiquitous and
loved by managers while hated by
statisticians, both without
justification. They are just a way to
visualize data.
:::

##

![](fiSimplePie.png)

::: {.notes}
One approach to making a pie is simple.
Start with the information, do the
process of making the pie chart, and
render the result. If we follow this
process, the emphasis is on the result
and this is common but, according to
Wilkinson, inadequate graphical practice.

Many programs have ways to select pie
chart, then fill in the information, then
see the pie. Wilkinson suggests that this
is wrong. We should choose the pie much
later in the process.
:::

##

![](fiDataToGraphic.png)

::: {.notes}
Instead, Wilkinson suggests this
approach, taking quite a few steps before
choosing the particular pie shape. Let's
review those steps.

(Review steps)

This picture only shows the ingredients
and their dependencies. It does not tell
how to assemble them.
:::

##

![](fiACLSdata.png)

::: {.notes}
Here is the data for our pie. The main
conclusion we can draw from this data is
that more females than males believe
there is bias favoring males in peer
review. It takes a while to arrive at
this conclusion because there is a lot to
read. It might be nice to have a quick
way to see this.
:::

##

![](fiSubtables.png)

::: {.notes}
The first process is to extract the data
we need from the data as a whole. This is
the process labeled "variables" in the
data flow diagram and it takes us from
data to a variable set.
:::

##

![](fiCrosstab.png)

::: {.notes}
The next process is called "algebra" and
consists of crosstabulating, or joining
the two subtables together, giving a more
manageable variable set.
:::

##

![](fiApplyScales.png)

::: {.notes}
The next process is called "scales" and
converts the variable set into integers.
In practice, software usually does this
for you but it is still an important step
and you must at least know how software
does it. For example, I have often seen
people inadvertently come away from a
software package with a counterintuitive
scaling where 5 means none and 1 means
frequently.
:::

##

![](fiComputeStats.png)

::: {.notes}
The next step is statistics and here we
see the computation of the summary
proportions or percentages.
:::

##

![](fiConstructGeom.png)

::: {.notes}
The next step is to construct geometry
and now we first see a graphical element.
It does not yet take on the
characteristic pie shape, it is simply
any area proportional to the statistics.
:::

##

![](fiApplyCoords.png)

::: {.notes}
Next we convert cartesian coordinates
into polar coordinates, turning the
rectangles into pie slices having a
radius and angle.
:::

##

![](fiComputeAesth.png)

::: {.notes}
Next we compute aesthetics, which are the
things we can see. Now the pie slices
take on their positions, colors, and
labels.
:::

##

![](fiPairPies.png)

::: {.notes}
Finally, we are ready to ship the result
to the renderer. Here is an example of
how we might do that, a list of
instructions to the renderer that result
from our processes.
:::

## CODA
Syntax and Semantics

::: {.notes}
We've just seen
an intro to syntax
which is one of two parts
of the grammar of graphics
:::

##
Subsequent chapters
of Part I treat
each of the concepts

::: {.notes}
so there is a chapter for algebra,
a chapter for scales, and so on, one for each of the process bubbles in the data flow diagram of how to make a pie
:::

##
The GoG also
includes semantics

::: {.notes}
This is the more visualization-
oriented part of the book according
to Wilkinson's definition of
visualization, which is more
restrictive than popular definitions
:::

##
Semantics include
space, time, and uncertainty

::: {.notes}
Notice that the first two are
potentially representations
or concepts we wish to visualize
while the third is strictly a
concept that we wish to visualize.

In other words, we may wish to visualize
space and time, but they are also
potentially vehicles for visualizing
other concepts.
:::

##
These concepts are treated
mathematically in Part II
of GoG

::: {.notes}
I'm skipping this because we
don't have time to give it the
weight it deserves and a brief
lecture with a lot of equations
won't be very memorable unless
you already have a math background

[Part II]{.r-fit-text}

## Semantics
We could look at any of the chapters, such as Time or Uncertainty, but we'll just look at Space for now

## Space
Four perspectives on space

- Terminology
- Mathematical Space
- Psychological Space
- Graphing Space

## Terminology
- graphics frame: a set of tuples ranging over all possible values in the domain of a $p$-dimensional varset
- tuple: a pair $(a,b)$
- $n$-tuple: a set $\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\}$ (note that this means that only pairs and sets can be depicted)
- graph: a subset of these tuples (note that Wilkinson separate defines graphs differently and we'll have to deal with that in a few slides from now)
- graphic: the perceptual realization of a graph

## Two kinds of space
- preceding definitions say that a graph is just a concept, not what we see: the graphic is what we see
- this means there are two kinds of space
  - underlying space (any space with a mathematical definition)
  - represented space (what we see: always 2$D$ or 3$D$)

## Example: beadlet anemones
![](fiBeadletAnemones.png)

::: {.notes}
These are tiny creatures, about two inches in diameter when fully grown, that live on rocks in oceans and estuaries. They often form colonies that can be diagrammed. Notice that the rock is 3$D$ but the diagram is 2$D$.
:::

## A minimum spanning tree of a rock covered with beadlet anemones
![](fiMinSpanningTree.png)

::: {.notes}
A minimum spanning tree is a mathematical construct you can derive from any group of like objects with some differing distances between them. The tree shows one path from a root (one of the beadlet anemones) to any branch or leaf (another beadlet anemone). You don't need to know the mathematical properties right now, just that more than one is possible for any given set of objects (usually a social network in real life) and one may be better than another. In this case, you would need to know something about beadlet anemones to understand which minimum spanning tree is best.
:::

## A different layout of the same tree
![](fiDifferentMST.png)

::: {.notes}
Here is a different minimum spanning tree of the beadlet anemones. It is mathematically identical to the one above except that it does not capture the geographic relationship of the anemones. The only difference is that the distance between the unlinked points is not meaningful. Only the links have meaning.
:::

## Display space and underlying space
The display space and the underlying space can have different relationships. If the display space misses information about the underlying space, we may not be able to understand the graphic. The graphic may reflect only part of the graph.

## Graphics as a mapping function
$f: S\rightarrow P$, where $S$ is the underlying mathematical space and $P$ is a Euclidean displace space represented by a *position* aesthetic. (Aesthetics are the things you can see, like texture, orientation, color, etc.)

To fully understand the graphic, you need to know the function $f$ and the underlying mathematical space $S$.

## Three perspectives on space
- Mathematical
- Psychological
- Graphical

## Mathematical space
Mathematical spaces have topological properties, for instance

- values may be on a continuum
- values may be categorical and hence isolated from each other
- values may lie in a compact region
- values may lie in an unbounded region

## Topological space
- a topological space $S$ is a set $X$ and a collection $T$ of subsets of $X$ satisfying these axioms
  - the empty set and $X$ are in $T$
  - the union of any number of sets in $T$ is also in $T$
  - the intersection of any two sets in $T$ is also in $T$

## Yet more terms
- the elements of $X$ are points
- The set $T$ is a topology on $X$
- the elements of $T$ are the open sets of $X$
- a subset of $X$ is closed if its complement is open
- any set $B$ is a basis for $T$ if every member of $T$ is a union of members of $B$

## Using the terms
We could go on to define topologies of the real number line using the previous definitions, but for now we'll just consider connected, totally disconnected, and discrete spaces

## Connected spaces
We can draw a line between any two points and that line can be meaningful, for example the two points could be temperatures and the line could represent the number of degrees between those temperatures

## Totally disconnected spaces
Each point is in a category so you can't draw a meaningful line between the categories. For example, each point is a species of bird and a line between two of them has no metric meaning

## Discrete spaces
